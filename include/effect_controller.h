/**
 * effect_controller.h - Abstract interface for effect controllers
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Defines the contract for all effect controllers. Controllers handle the
 * business logic for effects, including button presses, quantization modes,
 * and visual feedback. They decouple the effect logic from the audio DSP.
 *
 * DESIGN:
 * - Pure abstract interface (no implementation)
 * - Controllers own references to their audio effects
 * - Command pattern integration (handle button press/release)
 * - Visual feedback management (LEDs, display)
 *
 * PATTERN:
 * This follows the Controller pattern (similar to MVC, but for embedded):
 * - Model: AudioEffectBase (audio DSP)
 * - View: DisplayManager + InputIO (LEDs, display)
 * - Controller: IEffectController implementations (business logic)
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   class ChokeController : public IEffectController {
 *   public:
 *       ChokeController(AudioEffectChoke& effect) : m_effect(effect) {}
 *       bool handleButtonPress(const Command& cmd) override { ... }
 *       // ... implement other methods
 *   private:
 *       AudioEffectChoke& m_effect;
 *   };
